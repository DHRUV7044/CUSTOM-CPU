# CUSTOM-CPU

I BUILT CUSTOM CPU THIS REPO CONTAINS ALL THE FILES THAT I MADE FOR CPU

## Key Features & Benefits

This repository contains the design files for a custom-built CPU. Key features include:

*   **Custom Instruction Set:** Designed with a specific instruction set tailored to potential applications.
*   **Modular Design:** The CPU is designed with modular components like the ALU, Adder, Comparator, and Multiplier, allowing for easier understanding and modification.
*   **Educational Resource:** Serves as a learning resource for understanding CPU architecture and design principles.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

To view and potentially modify the design files, you'll need the following:

*   **Digital Logic Design Software:**  The `.dig` files likely require a digital logic simulator like Logisim-evolution or a similar tool. Check file extensions for specific tool requirements.
*   **PDF Viewer:** To view the instruction set documentation (`full_instruction_set_final.pdf`).

## Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DHRUV7044/CUSTOM-CPU.git
    cd CUSTOM-CPU
    ```

2.  **Install Digital Logic Design Software:**

    *   If the `.dig` files are Logisim-evolution files, download and install it from [https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital).

3.  **Open Design Files:**

    *   Use the installed digital logic design software to open the `.dig` files in the respective directories (e.g., `processor/ALU/ADDER/1 BIT ADDER.dig`).

4.  **View Instruction Set:**
    * Open the `INSTRUCTION SET/full_instruction_set_final.pdf` to understand the instruction set architecture.
